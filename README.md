Raspberry Pi / Micro:bit serial communications over USB tutorial 

This is a tutorial I wrote that was published on the micro:mag website (although this website no longer appears to exist). 

The submission documentation is in the [docs](https://github.com/colin-grant/serial-tutorial/tree/master/docs) folder whilst the code for the raspberry pi and micro:bit are in the [code](https://github.com/colin-grant/serial-tutorial/tree/master/code) folder.
